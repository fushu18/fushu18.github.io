I am an Assistant Professor in the School of International and Public Affairs at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

I specialize in American Politics and Political Methodology, using causal inference and text-as-data methods to study the performance of American political institutions. Specifically, my research interests include American presidency, executive-legislative relations, political communications, distributive politics, and Sino-US Relations. 

To date, my work has appeared or is forthcoming in _Journal of Politics_, _World Politics_ï¼Œ_Political Research Quarterly_, and _Presidential Studies Quarterly_.

Prior to Shanghai, I was a Teaching Fellow in the Department of Political Science and the College at the University of Chicago. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Chicago in 2021, and earned a B.A. and an M.A. from the Department of International Relations at Tsinghua University.
