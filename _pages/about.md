I am an Assistant Professor at School of International and Public Affairs in Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I specialize in American Politics and Political Methodology, using text-as-data methods and statistical models to study the performance of American political institutions. In specific, my research interests include American presidency, executive-legislative relations, political communications, distributive politics, text-as-data methods, and causal inference. To date, my work has been published in _Journal of Politics_, _World Politics_，_Political Research Quarterly_, and _Presidential Studies Quarterly_.

Prior to Shanghai, I was a Teaching Fellow at Department of Political Science and the College in the University of Chicago. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Chicago in 2021, and earned a B.A. and an M.A. from the Department of International Relations at Tsinghua University.
